# Handwritten_digit_recognition
A deep learning-based Handwritten Digit Recognition system using Keras and TensorFlow, implementing a CNN model for classifying digits (0-9) from images.

Features
✅ Trained using the MNIST dataset
✅ Implemented with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
✅ Uses the Adam optimizer for efficient training
✅ Graphical User Interface (GUI) with Tkinter for easy digit input
✅ Python script (predict_digit.py) for image-based digit prediction
